This lets you directly edit the 'control points' which define a NURBS object, and works on surfaces and solids as well as curves like these (we'll go into more detail on NURBS and control points in a later tutorial). Select the top corners of your rectangles and move them up the width of one bay, either by typing the distance or using one of the existing bays as a reference to snap to.
