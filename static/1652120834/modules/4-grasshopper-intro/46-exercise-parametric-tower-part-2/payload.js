Remember that components are designed to take a certain number of items in each input. If a component’s input is designed to take one item and you pass into it a List or DataTree, the component will run once for each item. The "},{type:b,tag:e,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:G}]},{type:a,value:" component is designed to take a List of Surfaces and join them all together.
