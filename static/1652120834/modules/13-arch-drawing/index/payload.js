A design proposal—or, for that matter any analysis, explanation, or argument—is only as powerful as the documentation which conveys it to its intended audience. The best way to communicate a spatial idea depends on its content, and new ideas call for new methods of representation. But there are drawing standards and conventions which are readily understood by other designers and those they collaborate with, and these provide a common baseline language for visual communication. Designers who are comfortable speaking this language can most effectively adapt, subvert, or innovate upon it to convey their ideas."}]},{type:a,value:c},{type:b,tag:j,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"This sequence is an introduction to the production of drawings using this common language.
