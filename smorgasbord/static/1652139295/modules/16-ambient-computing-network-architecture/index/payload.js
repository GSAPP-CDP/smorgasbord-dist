An oven has dials and knobs that take up physical space, so that when you interact with the oven you are not estranged from your environment. In contrast, dialing into a zoom call, one can be completely disembodied from their environment. You may forget that you are even sitting at home doing remote work while in a video call. What if we created new modes for communication where people were not required to actively stare at screens? Could we leverage ambient devices to make interactions that are tangible? In 10 years time, I hope we’re not all still buried in our phones or locked to video calls. I can’t imagine that’s possible with this suite of technologies burgeoning with spatial potential — it’s only a matter of time and the desire to move beyond the screen.
