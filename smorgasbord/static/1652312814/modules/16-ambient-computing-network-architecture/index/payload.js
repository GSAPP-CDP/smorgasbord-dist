They are particularly important to spatial designers, the designs of homes and cities as they are concerned with how our digital interactions relate to physical space and social contexts. But what is vs isn't ambient computing? So much of our interactions with technology occur in physical space. Ambient computing has two main properties to be aware of. First it is networked, and second it is embedded.","Networked (context, profile-based)","\nSmart home products, wearables, Amazon Go Stores, and mixed reality all fall within ambient computing with the importance being on devices that are in the environment and thus ","networked"," with other devices (often the cloud) so that these devices can make ","contextual decisions"," (who you are, who your with, where you are, when it is, etc).

An instagram feed on your phone doesn't have any context about whether you are commuting on a train with strangers or at home alone on your couch. Adiitionally the strangeness of today's UIs is that they are not very physical. Before digital inventions, mechanical interfaces were physical and bodily. An oven has dials and knobs that take up physical space, so that when you interact with the oven you are not estranged from your environment. In contrast, dialing into a zoom call, one can be completely disembodied from their environment. You may forget that you are even sitting at home doing remote work while in a video call. What if we created new modes for communication where people were not required to actively stare at screens? Could we leverage ambient devices to make interactions that are tangible? In 10 years time, I hope we’re not all still buried in our phones or locked to video calls. I can’t imagine that’s possible with this suite of technologies burgeoning with spatial potential — it’s only a matter of time and the desire to move beyond the screen.

We can design whole environments (rooms, public plazas) to have the intelligence of our computers, rather than individualized computers having such intelligence. This is a big opportunity to change the way people interact with technologies. Consider the social impact of devices structured around the individual rather than the group. Consider this scene: a family sitting around a television together vs a family where each individual is on their own device (phones, ipads, computers). How does individualized technology impact relationships? Designers should think about long term societal impacts of the behavior change their technologies influence.
